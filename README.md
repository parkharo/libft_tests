# first Draft
## Collaborate on libft tests, everything here is open to suggestions
* This is hopefully a way to both practice git collaboration and creat a comprehensive and efficent series of tests for the libft project.
* Its a work in progress as we all still have to actually do the project
### GOALS
1. have a comprehensive series of tests which give meaninful error message
2. have a main.c a .h and a testfunction.c for each lib function 
3. these sholud compile to .o files which are subsequently linked and compiled with your own libft like so:
4. gcc *.o -L<libftpath> -lft
5. functions should be named in a consistant manner like "test_<functionname>.c"
#### TO DO
* add makefile
* work out meaningful error message if a function is missing from your personal libft when tested
